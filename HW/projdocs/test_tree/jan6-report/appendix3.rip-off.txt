            APPENDIX 3: THE BIG RIP-OFF: FOLLOW THE MONEY
            Introduction
            This appendix will consider the extent to which President Trumps Campaign and related
               entities raised an unprecedented amount of political donations using inflammatory
               messaging alleging that the 2020 U.S. Presidential election was fraudulent or stolen.
               It will review what tools and methods were used to produce, transmit and optimize
               these fundraising solicitations; who drafted and approved the messaging and what they
               knew about the accuracy of the messaging; who ultimately benefitted from these donations;
               and the impact of these messages on their recipients.
            The Select Committees investigation demonstrates that President Trumps baseless
               claims of election fraudthe Big Lieserved a dual purpose, forming the foundation
               of his attempts to overturn the 2020 Presidential election and launching a fundraising
               effort to fund the former Presidents other endeavors and to enrich his associatesthe
               Big Rip-off. 
            The false election fraud narrative embedded in fundraising emails and text messages
               amplified the Big Lie by perpetuating a belief that the 2020 election was stolen from
               President Trump and effectuated the Big Rip-off by misleading donors into thinking
               their donations could alter the election results. 
            At the same time, the Big Lie helped President Trump and the Republican National Committee
               (RNC) raise more than $250 million after the election, much of it from small-dollar
               donors who were promised their money would Stop the Steal. 
            Despite what they told their supporters, however, most of their money was not used
               to stop any purported stealit was diverted to accomplish the Big Rip-off. Millions
               of dollars that were raised ostensibly for election defense and fighting voter
               fraud were not spent that way at all.
            Moreover, the Select Committees investigation shows that the RNC knew that President Trumps claims about winning the election were baseless and that post-election
               donations would not help him secure an additional term in office. Yet, both the Trump
               Campaign and the RNC decided to continue fundraising after the election, a decision that would have come from President Trump himself. 
            In short, President Trump and his Campaign ripped off supporters by raising more than
               $250 million by claiming they wanted to fight fraud they knew did not exist and to
               challenge an election they knew he lost. 
            Discussion
            The Trump Campaign Fundraising Team
            As detailed below, the Trump Campaign misled the American public and President Trumps
               donors on how they planned to use, and did use, the donated funds while bombarding
               supporters with hundreds of emails, as many as twenty-five emails per day, stating
               the election had been stolen. In those emails, they used inflammatory language accusing
               Democrats of trying to steal the election, encouraged supporters to join the Trump
               army; Defend the election: and to fight back over, and over, and over again.1 They sent these emails out because they knew they were effective at raising money.2 This was made possible by the creation of a fundraising machine powered jointly by
               the Trump Campaign and the RNC.
            A. The TMAGAC Fundraising Machine
            During the 2020 election cycle, President Trump operated a structure under which the
               Trump reelection campaign and the RNC merged programs and raised money jointly through the Trump Make
               America Great Again Committee (internally referred to by its acronym TMAGAC, which
               RNC officials pronounced T-Magic).3 TMAGAC was focused on raising money online through small-dollar donations.4 Tim Murtaugh, the Trump Campaigns communications director, described the TMAGAC fundraising operation as an entity unto itself within the
               campaign.5 
            The individual charged with leading the digital operation in 2020 was Gary Coby.6 Coby first started working with the RNC in 2016 even before President Trump became
               the nominee.7 Coby explained that, as digital director, his role during the 2020 Presidential election cycle was to oversee the digital operation.8 Similarly, senior staffers at the Trump Campaign and the RNC all made clear that Coby was the individual in charge of the TMAGAC
               digital team.9 Both high-level staffers at the Trump Campaign and at the RNC confirmed that Coby had the trust of Jared Kushner, the Presidents son-in-law.10 
            Coby explained that during the 2020 Presidential election cycle, the TMAGAC digital team was a big team with multiple
               organizations and vendor teams all working together as one, that include[d] RNC staff,
               [Donald J. Trump for President] staff, [and] maybe a half dozen vendor teams.11 The RNC digital team, a subset of the TMAGAC digital team, was led operationally
               by Kevin Zambrano, Chief Digital Officer at the RNC. In 2020, members of the digital
               staff of both the RNC and Trump Campaign merged in an office building in Arlington, Virginia, with some suites jointly
               hosting RNC and Trump Campaign staff on the digital team, and other suites hosting third-party companies,
               such as Opn Sesame and Direct Persuasion.12 Thereafter, Zambrano assisted Coby in managing the TMAGAC digital team.13 Zambrano explained, The majority of the staff was at the RNC doing both RNC and
               TMAGAC work.14 This work was focused squarely on fundraising.15 
            The RNC digital team included Austin Boedigheimer, who, starting in January 2019, was the RNCs digital deputy director16 and technically served as Zambranos deputy.17 In reality, Boedigheimer reported to both Zambrano and Coby.18 Boedigheimer also led the TMAGAC digital fundraising team, which was comprised of
               all online fundraising efforts, including fundraising emails and text messages.19 At the end of the 2020 cycle, that team had 20 or 30 people within smaller teams,
               such as the copy team, the text message team, the data team, the advertising team,
               and the graphics team.20
            The RNC digital team also included a team of copywriters, who were responsible for
               writing the fundraising emails and text messages to solicit small-dollar donations
               through TMAGAC.21 These copywriters reported to Hanna Allred, the RNCs Chief Copywriter.22 By mid-2020, there were three copywriters who reported to Allred: Alex Murglin,23 Ethan Katz,24 and Alex Blinkoff.25 Blinkoff and Katz worked in that role from June 2020 until they were fired approximately three
               weeks after the 2020 election, while Murglin remains a copywriter at the RNC. 
            Although the TMAGAC team consisted of both Trump Campaign and RNC staffers, TMAGAC operated as one entity working towards one goal 
               raising as much money as possible.26
            B. The Fundraising Assembly Line
            The copywriting process worked like an assembly line, where different individuals
               performed a task and passed on the work product to someone else, including for internal
               approval.27 To generate content for fundraising communications, Allred explained, the copywriting
               fundraising team was watching the messaging coming out of the committee [RNC] and the campaign and from the President himself and what his family was talking about.28 For example, in a November 2020 email, Boedigheimer stated to Allred, Good to include
               lines like []we need the resources to make sure they dont try to steal this election.
               We saw what happened on election night, we cant let them take the senate too.[]29 
            It was evident that the copywriters would draft a lot of the content based on . .
               . what the President was saying.30 And there was no mistaking it, President Trump was providing us [the copywriters]
               with a lot of content online.31 Allred said Boedigheimer was encouraging her to use this language because it would
               cause President Trumps supporters to donate by giving a purpose to their donation32 and that they used this repeatedly because it worked.33 Boedigheimer did not dispute this, and reaffirmed that such language had been successful
               at fundraising.34
            Further, the emails that were signed by President Trump or Team Trump were intentionally
               drafted to capture President Trumps voice, tone and messaging.35 Boedigheimer explained, [President Trump] obviously has a very aggressive[,] excitable
               tone, and we would try to incorporate that in our messaging as well.36 The goal was to make the millions of recipients of aggressive, hyperbolic fundraising
               emails believe that the emails were coming from President Trump himself. In Zambranos
               words, the purpose was to give recipients red meat. 37 
            C. The Approvals Process
            The Structure
            Draft emails were submitted for approval to a designated group that handled approvals
               of all TMAGAC fundraising copy (the Approvals Group).38 Boedigheimer retained responsibility for ensuring that TMAGACs fundraising copy
               was approved before being sent to the public.39 
            The Approvals Group consisted of three sets of stakeholders from the RNC and the Trump
               Campaign,40 and included a variety of other interested staffers, including Zambrano, Boedigheimer,
               and Allred.41 TMAGACs fundraising copy could not be sent without approval from the legal, communications
               and research departments.42 
            Perceived Responsibilities
            After election day, a small group of staffers in the Approvals Group actively reviewed
               and approved the numerous fundraising emails and text messages that spread false election
               fraud claims. These staffers included: 
            
               RNC Legal: Justin Reimer, RNC Chief Counsel43 and Jenna Kirsch, RNC Associate Counsel44
               RNC Communications: Cassie Docksey, Deputy Communications Director45
               RNC Research: Michael Reed, Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications46
               Trump Campaign Legal: Alex Cannon, Deputy General Counsel47
               Trump Campaign Communications and Research: Zach Parkinson, Deputy Director of Communications and Director of Research48
            
            Boedigheimer, as head of the fundraising team handling the drafting and propagation
               of fundraising messaging, told the Select Committee his understanding of the role
               the three components of the Approvals Group (legal, communications, and research)
               performed when reviewing emails and text messages. 
            Regarding legal, Boedigheimer explained that he understood Alex Cannons role, as the Trump Campaigns Deputy General Counsel, was to review the emails from a legal perspective
               by essentially making sure that theres no legal issues with the content.49 
            Regarding communications, Boedigheimer stated that the communications staffers in the Approvals Group were reviewing the
               content and [m]aking sure that its on message and good from a comms perspective.50 
            Lastly, Boedigheimer explained that the research team was looking for . . . things that are inaccurate.51 
            Although Boedigheimer provided only a vague explanation of the role of the Approvals Group, he emphasized
               that he had to trust that the research, the comms, and the legal team are going to
               do their processes to make sure its [the TMAGAC fundraising copy was] accurate.52 He further noted, [I]t was the approval chain[]s job to see what the accuracy of the email is and whether its true or not. . . .
               We were sending information and then leaning on our approval chain to make sure that
               its accurate.53
            The Select Committees investigation revealed that the Approvals Group did not operate
               that way, however. The Select Committee interviewed members of the Approvals Group
               handling the communications, research, and legal functions and confirmed that members
               of the Approvals Group typically engaged only in cursory reviews of the fundraising
               messages and did not review substantive claims of election fraud for accuracy.
            Zach Parkinson, the Trump Campaigns Deputy Director of Communications and Research Director, represented the
               Trump Campaigns communications and research functions in the Approvals Group. Parkinson
               made clear, Generally, our role when it came to fundraising emails and texts was
               to approve them for the communications team.54 Parkinson noted that that he was typically the person who weighed in on behalf of
               the Trump Campaigns communications and research team.55 He added, we would review them for messaging consistency, sometimes we would review
               them for factual accuracy, and then we would provide the communications approval for
               those.56 
            Parkinson clarified that the scope of review for factual accuracy was limited. Specifically, his review of fundraising emails and
               text messages for accuracy was limited to questions concerning items such as time
               and location.57 
            Critically, Parkinson did not review statements regarding election fraud in the fundraising
               copy for accuracy because most political text messages and fundraising emails are
               political rhetoric, and so a lot of them dont necessarily require fact checking.58 He added that political rhetoric, such as Democrats are trying to steal the election,
               was not something he and his team were necessarily tasked to say no to.59 Parkinson made clear that he thought the legal department, namely Alex Cannon, would
               handle reviewing for accuracy, noting I deferred to the legal team on the legitimacy
               and the ability to substantiate claims that were made that were put through these
               approvals and whether or not we could, again, substantiate them or they were in line
               with our legal efforts.60 Parkinson, as the head of the research team, the very campaign team meant to fact-check
               and ensure accuracy in the Trump Campaigns statements, said he was simply looking for messaging consistency.61 Whether Democrats were engaged in fraud to steal the election was a political argument
               to Parkinson, which he did not review for accuracy.62 
            Like Parkinson, Michael Reed, then the RNCs Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications,
               was not reviewing the TMAGAC emails about election fraud for broader accuracy. Notably,
               Reed could not recall a single email that he researched to do a fact-check or follow
               up on to see if claims contained in the email were, in fact, true.63
            Boedigheimer and the copywriters believed the research staffers were looking for messages
               that they believed were inaccurate, but they were doing no such thing. 
            Alex Cannon, the Trump Campaigns legal representative in the Approvals Group, was no differentthe TMAGAC fundraisers thought he was doing far more than he was in fact doing. The
               Select Committee received a November 4, 2020, email from Nathan Groth, counsel for the Trump Campaign, to Alex Cannon. This email reflected that Cannon was not tasked with substantively
               reviewing fundraising emails like Boedigheimer thought. Groth wrote to Cannon, Matt [Morgan, Trump Campaigns General Counsel] has instructed me to hand off all compliance matters, including approvals, to you.64 Cannon confirmed, I saw myself as doing exactly what I was instructed to do here,
               which is do what Nathan had previously been doing. So its this. Its compliance issues like disclaimers and typos.65 Therefore, when Cannon received emails that included claims such as the Democrats
               are trying to steal the election, he viewed reviewing the veracity of this statement
               as outside the purview of what [he] was tasked.66 When asked, Cannon stated that he did not know who was tasked with ensuring that
               fundraising emails were true and accurate.67 
            Boedigheimer, and other members of the digital fundraising team he led, claimed to
               see the Approvals Group as a guardrail of sorts in the fundraising effort to protect
               from the dissemination of false messaging about the election, but the Approvals Group
               served no such role. The very staffers in the Approvals Group repeatedly told the
               Select Committee that they did not review the claims about election fraud to confirm
               whether they were even true. 
            When all was said and done, no one in the Trump Campaign claimed to be responsible for confirming the accuracy of President Trumps
               words, or other allegations of election fraud, before they were blasted to millions
               of Americans.68
            Thus, after the election, the TMAGAC team drafted emails filled with inflammatory
               and unfounded claims, and the members of the Approvals Group tasked with fact checking
               these claims did no such thingeffectively, President Trumps claims were treated
               as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked
               with ensuring accuracy. This process was a fertile ground for the Big Lie to spread
               through hundreds of emails and text messages. 
            D. Focus on Fundraising Metrics 
            Boedigheimer spoke with Coby and Zambrano often about how much money TMAGAC was raising,
                  and they provided feedback regarding fundraising goals.69 Trump Campaign leadership was fully aware of post-election fundraising totals. According
                  to Coby, President Trumps son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner had the most
                  interest in the digital program and would just check in on [fundraising] results,
                  and routinely received updates regarding fundraising from Coby.70 Coby also made clear that Kushner was heavily involved in the Campaigns budget process71 and that he updated Kushner on TMAGACs post-election fundraising totals.72 
            The Select Committee received documents confirming Kushners involvement. For example,
                  on November 8, 2020, Kushner requested that a daily tracker be created showing the
                  Trump Campaigns financial position from election day forward.73 In an email, Kushner noted that the tracker would allow the Campaign to consider its cash flow ahead of the creation of a new entity for POTUS[s] other political activities.74 Just days after the election, and after the Campaign had three of its four best fundraising days ever on November 4th, 5th, and 6th,75 Kushner was preparing for the launch of President Trumps new leadership PAC, Save
                  America. Kushner stated that he needed this new daily tracker because the Trump Campaign was going to continue fundraising post-election.76 Kushner continued to receive these detailed daily trackers, which included Save Americas
                  fundraising hauls, through at least December 2020.77 
            2020 ELECTION: THE ROLE OF ELECTION FRAUD MESSAGING
            A. The Decision to Continue Fundraising after Election Day
            Heading into election night of the 2020 Presidential race, as Americans across the country waited in line to vote on election day, the Trump
               Campaign and the RNC were planning what they would tell the American public about the
               results in the upcoming days. On election day, Boedigheimer and Darren Centinello, a Trump Campaign staffer, discussed the three message options that the Trump Campaign had on the table.78 
            The first option was to send out copy claiming President Trump had won the 2020 election. But the Campaign knew this message was false, and Boedigheimer told Centinello that he could not get this messaging approved yet.79 The Trump Campaigns second option was an email stating they were still waiting on the election
               results. This message would have been the truth. The Campaign rejected this option. 
            Instead, the Trump Campaign chose a third option. Boedigheimer confirmed that TMAGAC fundraisers had received
               approval for copy claiming that the Democrats are going to try to steal the election
               before election night.80 
            Zambrano confirmed that it would not surprise him that TMAGAC was immediately claiming
               that Democrats were trying to steal the election, because President Trump has been
               pushing that message.81 Zambrano added, That was the Presidents phrasing in the messaging that the team
               was sourcing from.82 Importantly, Boedigheimer confirmed that the TMAGAC copywriting team did not base its use of the trying to steal language on any awareness of actual fraud.83 
            B. Post-Election Fundraising Off the Big Lie
            Both the Trump Campaign and the RNC directed TMAGAC to continue fundraising after the election.84 Justin Clark, the deputy campaign manager, explained that the decision to continue fundraising after the election would
               have come from President Trump himself.85
            Starting after the election and until January 6th, the Trump Campaign, along with the RNC, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging
               such as claiming that the election was RIGGED.86 The Trump Campaign viewed the TMAGAC emails as another avenue to get out President Trumps post-election
               messaging about the alleged fraud.87 These emails used false claims of voter fraud to create a sense of urgency that the
               election was being stolen. The Trump Campaign and the RNC told their supporters that their donations could stop Democrats
               from trying to steal the election. They consistently encouraged donors to give money
               to continue uncovering fraud that had not occurred. These emails were sent out after
               being reviewed and approved by the Approvals Group.88 
            The TMAGAC fundraisers used inflammatory language and false election fraud claims
               after the election because it was both effective at fundraising and accurately captured
               President Trumps ongoing tone and messaging.89 When the digital fundraising team drafted emails claiming, for example, that Democrats
               are trying to steal the election, they did not bother to confirm whether or not those
               inflammatory statements were true, and instead they merely took President Trumps words and made an effective fundraising email.90 As Zambrano stated, the President issuing statements or tweets would be the genesis
               of the copy that would then go into the approval process for edits, for checks. That
               is why the approval process worked.91 President Trump was the source of the lies. Not only was President Trumps fundraising
               driven by his daily deluge of lies about the election, but these lies were also able
               to go unchallenged before being spread because TMAGAC had an ineffective process when
               it came to scrutinizing and correcting those lies.
            The TMAGAC fundraising machine continued to churn out hundreds of fundraising emails
                  and text messages regardless of external developments. For example, Zambrano said
                  that, after former Vice President Biden was widely declared the winner of the election, TMAGACs fundraising
                  efforts moved ahead the same way they had previously,92 even though he would say it wasnt looking good as soon as one week after the election.93 
            ALARMS RAISED ABOUT TMAGAC FUNDRAISING CONTENT
            A number of individuals and entities associated with the TMAGAC fundraising campaign
                  raised concerns about the dangerous and inflammatory language used in the emails issued
                  for this campaign. 
            Concerns Raised in Internal RNC Review
            Evidence obtained by the Select Committee shows that the RNC knew that President Trumps
                  claims about winning the election were baseless and that additional donations would
                  not help him secure an additional term in office. They walked as close to the line
                  as they daredmaking several changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected
                  the RNC from legal exposure while still spreading and relying on President Trumps
                  known lies and misrepresentations. 
            The Select Committee did not interview a member of the RNC legal team due to concerns
               surrounding attorney-client privilege, but the Select Committee nonetheless got insight
               into their role from documents produced by Campaign and RNC staff, as well as interviews
               with staffers. As detailed below, the RNC lawyers were the only individuals who even
               attempted to walk back the fundraising emails.
            Allred and Katz both received direction from the RNCs lawyers shortly after the election
                  to not say steal the election and instead were told to use try to steal the election.94 Allred also recalled that, at some point, the RNC legal team directed the copywriters
                  not to use the term rigged.95
            After the media called the election for former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday,
                  November 7, 2020, the RNC began to quietly pull back from definitive language about
                  President Trump having won the election and instead used language of insinuation. For example, on November 10, 2020, Justin Reimer, RNCs then-chief counsel, revised a fundraising email sent to the Approvals Group to remove the sentence that
                  Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President.96 Instead, Reimer indicated the email should read, Joe Biden does not get to decide when this election ends. Only LEGAL ballots must
                  be counted and verified.97 Both Alex Cannon and Zach Parkinson signed off on Reimers edits.98 
            On November 11, 2020, Reimer again revised a fundraising email sent to the Approvals
                  Group. This time, he revised a claim that President Trump won this election by a
                  lot to instead state that President Trump got 71 MILLION LEGAL votes.99 Once again Cannon and Parkinson signed off on Reimers edits.100 
            Also on November 11, 2020, Jenna Kirsch, associate counsel at the RNC, revised a fundraising email sent to the Approvals Group to, among other things, remove
                  the request to step up and contribute to our critical Election Defense Fund so that we can DEFEND the Election and secure FOUR MORE YEARS.101 Instead of secure FOUR MORE YEARS, Kirschs revised version stated a contribution would finish the fight.102 Once again Cannon and Parkinson signed off on these edits for the Trump Campaign.103 Regarding the change to finish the fight, Zambrano conceded, I would say this a substantive change from the legal department.104 Kirsch made numerous edits like this, in which she removed assertions about four
                  more years.105 Such edits continued into late November 2020. 
            Further, Boedigheimer stated that he took questions to RNC legal in the post-election period about TMAGAC
               fundraisers using the steal the election language.106 The RNC was clearly aware that President Trumps claims regarding the election were
               not true and tried to have it both ways. 
            The private split between the RNC and the Trump Campaign became even more pronounced when President Trump decided to double down on
               his false election fraud claims and chose Rudolph Giuliani to lead his legal efforts
               to overturn the election.107 On November 19, 2020, Giuliani held a press conference at the RNCs headquarters
               in which he falsely suggested that the Biden Campaign orchestrated an elaborate nationwide voter-fraud scheme.108 Cassie Docksey, a senior RNC staffer at the time, recalled that she spoke that day with Michael Ahrens, then the RNCs communications director, about the diverging from the Trump Campaign.109 Ahrens told her that the RNC would no longer automatically amplify or replicate statements
               from the Trump Campaign or President Trumps legal team.110 Docksey understood Ahrens to be relaying a decision made at the most senior levels of the
               RNC.111 
            Ahrens asserted that the RNC was unwilling to adopt the wide-ranging, baseless assertions
               President Trumps legal team was making and quietly decided to focus its communication
               strategy elsewhere.112 Distancing the RNC from President Trumps false statements was a regular course
               of the job before the election, and it carried through after the election in relation to President Trumps false
               claims about the election.113 Starting at or before the November 19, 2020, press conference, the RNC senior leadership was in agreement that they would not
               claim that President Trump had won the election,114 although the RNC frequently had to have internal discussions about President Trumps
               false statements about the election.115 
            According to Michael Reed, then the RNCs deputy chief of staff for communications, there were conversations amongst [RNC] legal and comms and digital
               to ensure that anything that was being written by the digital team based off of something
               President Trump or the Campaign said was something we all were more comfortable with.116 RNC Chairwoman McDaniel was a part of these conversations.117 
            RNC leadership knew that President Trump was lying to the American people. Yet, they
               did nothing to publicly distance themselves from his efforts to overturn the election.
               The RNCs response was merely to tinker around the edges of the fundraising copy but
               never to fundamentally challenge the one message that remained present in TMAGACs
               post-election fundraising copyPresident Trumps Big Lie. 
            In the end, multiple senior RNC staffers approved fundraising emails raising questions
                  about the election results even though they did not know of any evidence about fraud
                  impacting the winner of the 2020 Presidential election. For example, Cassie Docksey stated that she was not aware of any fraud that impacted the results of the Presidential election.118 Ahrens conceded that there was not evidence that we [the RNC] had seen that he [President Trump] won the election, that Biden had not won the election.119 
            Similarly, Justin Clark was not aware of [fraudulent activity . . . to like defraud
                  voters] by an individual or an entity that would have [changed the outcome of an election].120 Alex Cannon did not find or see, in [his] limited ability as one individual . . . evidence that
               would be sufficient within the time period to change any sort of election results
               in any of the States.121 
            Nonetheless, the RNC and the Trump Campaign continued to send out hundreds of emails,
                  spreading the Big Lie to and fundraising off of millions of supporters. Even though
                  the RNC had closely held reservations about repeating the most extreme and unsupportable
                  claims of fraud, the RNC stayed the course with a coordinated, single fundraising
                  plan with the Trump Campaign. The RNC privately and quietly softened the most blatantly
                  egregious claims written by its own copywriters but publicly stood shoulder to shoulder
                  with President Trump and his Big Lie.
            This is clearly evidenced by multiple TMAGAC emails in late December 2020 that asserted
                  that former Vice President Joe Biden would be an illegitimate President when he took office.122 These emails came after December 14, 2020, the day electors from each State met to cast their votes for President and Vice President. These emails came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear that he accepted the electoral colleges certification of Bidens victory.
               These emails came after President Trump and his allies had lost all but one lawsuit
               challenging the election.123 None of this made a difference to TMAGAC. When asked why TMAGAC would repeatedly
               send these emails stating that former Vice President Biden would be an illegitimate
               President, Hanna Allred, the chief copywriter, stated that it would be because the
               emails were effective for fundraising.124 
            Trump Campaign Discussions 
            Alex Cannon was so bothered by the emails he was reviewing as a member of the Approvals
                  Group that he took his concerns to Justin Clark, the campaigns deputy campaign manager. Cannon explained that he had discussions with Clark about the problematic tone of
                  the post-election TMAGAC emails and noted to Clark that the emails seemed a little
                  over the top to [him].125 Cannon raised those concerns because, after spending weeks researching which fraud
                  claims were verifiable and which were not, Cannon saw that the TMAGAC emails were
                  inconsistent with the fact that systemic fraud did not exist.126 Cannon also recalled that he may have expressed concern to Matt Morgan, the campaigns general counsel, regarding the difference between claims of election fraud made in the TMAGAC fundraising
                  emails and his conclusion that there was not fraud that impacted the election results.127 Cannon was not aware of any actions taken to address the concerns he had with this inconsistency.128
            Justin Clark could not recall whether he looked at any fundraising emails after Cannon
                  raised these concerns or whether Cannon spoke to Gary Coby about the substance of the fundraising emails.129
            Challenges From Within the Digital Team 
            In the days after the election, one junior copywriter presented senior Campaign staffers with a template for a more honest approach. Shortly after election
               night, Coby led a meeting of the entire Trump digital team, which included individuals
               from the Campaign, the RNC, Opn Sesame, Direct Persuasion, and others. In that meeting, as Coby addressed the staff
               and expressed that the digital team would continue to work, Ethan Katz, an RNC staffer
               in his early twenties, rose to ask a question:130 How were staffers supposed to tell voters that the Trump Campaign wanted to keep
               counting votes in Arizona but stop counting votes in other States (like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan)?131 
            Katz said that Coby provided an answer without substance, which caused Katz to reiterate
               his question. His question made clear that the Campaigns position was wildly inconsistent.132 Allred and Boedigheimer corroborated that Katz confronted leadership.133 
            Katz also recalled that, shortly after the election, Allred directed him to write
               an email declaring that President Trump had won the State of Pennsylvania before anyone had called Pennsylvania for either party.134 Katz believed the Trump Campaign wanted to send this email out to preempt a potential call that was likely
               to be in former Vice President Bidens favor.135 He refused to write the email. Allred was stunned, and instead assigned it to another
               copywriter.136 Allred confirmed that Katz expressed discomfort at writing such an email and that she relied on another copywriter.137 On November 4, 2020, the Trump Campaign sent out an email preemptively and falsely declaring that President Trump
               won Pennsylvania.138 
            Katz was fired approximately three weeks after the election.139 In an interview with the Select Committee, when Allred was asked why Katz, her direct
               report, was fired, she explained that she was not sure why because TMAGAC was raising
               more money than ever after the election, but that the decision was not hers to make.140
            Concerns Raised by Trump Campaign Vendor Iterable
            The Trump Campaign knew that emails that the Approvals Group had blessed were being rejected
               by another email service provider. After the election, the Trump Campaign attempted to expand the reach of their false voter fraud emails. The Trump
               Campaign formed a company named DataPier, owned by Cannon and Sean Dollman.141 DataPier hired an outside company named Iterable to deliver its emails.142 Cannon tried to send toned-down RNC emails, through Iterable, but they still had to be further toned [] down through [an] iterative process[.]143 For example, on November 7, 2020, Seth Charles, who was then Iterables principal email deliverability and industry relations manager, said that there was an issue with the TMAGAC copy and offered line edits.144 Two days later, Charles recommended to the Trump Campaign staffers that they look for modified copy there [from TMAGAC emails] to be a little less threatening.145 Charles claimed that some TMAGAC copy obviously insinuates the so far unsubstantiated
               theory of voter fraud, as well as contributions and legal actions will result in some
               sort of different outcome.146 
            But Salesforce, TMAGACs original email service provider, continued sending millions
               of Trump Campaign emails up until January 6th. 
            Internal Complaints at Salesforce 
            The Trump Campaign knew that emails that the Approvals Group had blessed were being
               rejected by Iterable. However, the RNC continued to send millions of Trump Campaign
               emails through Salesforce, TMAGACs original email service provider, up until January
               6th. Evidence uncovered by the Select Committee shows that there were internal concerns
               at Salesforce regarding the content of the TMAGAC emails.
            The Select Committee interviewed an individual (J. Doe) who worked at Salesforce
               during the post-election period during which TMAGAC was sending out the fundraising
               emails concerning false election fraud claims.147 Doe worked for Salesforces privacy and abuse management team, colloquially known as the abuse desk.148 An abuse desk is responsible for preventing fraud and abuse emanating from the providers
               user or subscriber network.
            Doe indicated to the Select Committee that, as soon as early 2020, they recalled issues arising with the RNCs use of Salesforces services
               and that a deluge of abuse wouldve started in June-ish.149 Doe noted that Salesforce received a high number of complaints regarding the RNCs
               actions, which would have been primarily the fundraising efforts of TMAGAC.150 In the latter half of 2020, Doe noticed that the emails coming from the RNCs account
               included more and more violent and inflammatory rhetoric in violation of Salesforces
               Master Service Agreement (MSA) with the RNC, which prohibited the use of violent
               content.151 Doe stated that, near the time of the election, they contacted senior individuals
               at Salesforce to highlight the increasingly concerning emails coming from the RNCs
               account.152 Doe explained that senior individuals at Salesforce effectively ignored their emails
               about TMAGACs inflammatory emails153 and Salesforce ignored the terms of the MSA and permitted the RNC to continue to
               use its account in this problematic manner.154 Doe said, Salesforce very obviously didnt care about anti-abuse.155
            Ultimately, the Trump Campaign and the RNC let the Big Lie spread because they were making hundreds
                  of millions of dollars from President Trumps supporters who believed that lie. The
                  Big Rip-off needed the Big Lie to motivate unsuspecting individuals to donate their
                  money to a lost cause, and it worked.
            WHERE DID THE MONEY GO?
            The Trump Campaign and the RNC had three of their largest fundraising days of the 2020 election
               cycle immediately after the election.156 Together, the Trump Campaign and the RNC raised more than one hundred million dollars
               in three days, telling people they were raising the money for the Official Election
               Defense Fund. According to the TMAGAC fundraising pitches, the Trump Campaign and RNC team had created a so-called Official Election Defense Fund to help pay for legal challenges to the election results.157 But there was no Official Election Defense Fund  it was simply a marketing tactic.158 The TMAGAC fundraisers did not know where the donated money was actually going.159 The TMAGAC copywriting team simply took the lies that President Trump told them about
               the need to raise money to overturn the election results and put them into emails
               to his supporters.
            The false claims of election fraud and the Official Election Defense Fund were so
               successful President Trump and his allies raised more than $250 million after the election.160 However, the Trump Campaign was raising too much money to spend solely on their legal
               efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The Trump Campaign continued
               to publicly state the election had been stolen by the Left, while behind closed
               doors they prepared a new plan to spend their supporters money.
            A. The Creation of the Save America PAC
            On November 9, 2020, President Trump created a separate leadership PAC called Save
               America that allowed him to keep millions of dollars raised after the election and
               spend it with very few restrictions in the future. Jared Kushner worked with Alex
               Cannon, Deputy General Counsel for the Trump Campaign, in creating the entity.161 Prior to the formation of Save America, any money raised by the Trump Campaign could
               effectively only be spent on recount and election-contest related expenses, and to
               pay off campaign debt.162 But now the money raised into Save America could allow President Trump to pay for
               his personal expenses, such as travel or hotel stays. After Save America was formed,
               it was added to the TMAGAC joint fundraising agreement with the RNC, and the percentage
               of the proceeds allocated to the Trump Campaign began to flow to Save America.163
            Importantly, Save America, as a leadership PAC, was not even legally permitted to
               pay for recount and election-contest related expenses in excess of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) limit of $5,000.164 Save America never hit that limit in 2020, as it spent no money on recount and election-contest
               related expenses.165
            Several reporters noticed the switch and contacted the Campaign asking about the bait and switch and the misleading nature of the emails.
               One reporter said directly: its misleading to raise money for a committee marked
               on the website as an election defense fund if its going to a leadership PAC.166 Another reporter asked, Why is the campaign telling its supporters they are contributing
               toward an Election Defense Fund if only a small percentage of those funds are actually
               going toward funding legal efforts? and How can the campaign justify directing 75%
               of contributions intended for a 2020 legal fund toward the Presidents political action
               committee?167 
            The Trump Campaign came up with a messaging plan about this tactic, which President Trump personally
               approved.168 Tim Murtaugh, the Trump Campaigns communications director, repeatedly asked Justin Clark, the deputy campaign manager, whether they should respond to the reporters.169 When Murtaugh flagged that the communications team was not responding to the reporters,
               Justin Clark said, Good. Dont.170 
            B. Outlays to Trump-Associated Individuals and Companies
            The Trump Campaign spent the money on President Trump, giving donations to his associates,
               and keeping it for himself in Save America. Hundreds of millions of dollars that were
               raised to go towards election defense and fighting voter fraud were not spent
               that way at all. To the contrary, most of the funds remain unspent, and millions have
               been paid to companies that are known affiliates of President Trump, or payments to
               entities associated with former Trump administration officials. Since the election,
               former Trump officials who are still working for President Trumps PACs, and are publicly
               receiving salaries as FEC-reported payroll, are also associated with these companies.
               
            For example, from July 2021 to the present, Save America has been paying approximately
               $9,700 per month to Dan Scavino,171 a political adviser who served in the Trump administration as White House Deputy
               Chief of Staff.172 Save America was also paying $20,000 per month to an entity called Hudson Digital
               LLC. Hudson Digital LLC was registered in Delaware twenty days after the attack on the Capitol, on January 26, 2021,173 and began receiving payments from Save America on the day it was registered.174 Hudson Digital LLC has received payments totaling over $420,000, all described as
               Digital consulting.175 No website or any other information or mention of Hudson Digital LLC could be found
               online.176 Though Hudson Digital LLC is registered as a Delaware company, the FEC Schedule B
               listing traces back to an address belonging to Dan and Catherine Scavino.177
            Nick Luna, President Trumps former personal assistant and body man, was being paid from April 2021 to December 2021 approximately $12,000 per month by Save America for payroll.178 The Make America Great Again PAC (MAGA PAC)  formerly the authorized committee of
               President Trumps reelection campaign, Donald J. Trump for President  paid $20,000
               per month to a limited liability corporation called Red State Partners LLC from April
               2021 through October 2021, and Save America paid Red State Partners LLC $20,000 in
               February 2022.179 The company was registered in Delaware on March 11, 2021180 and has received a total of $170,000.181 Though it is registered in Delaware, disclosures filed with the Federal Election
               Committee (FEC) list Red State Partners at an address in Miami, Florida, that is an address for Nick Luna and his wife, Cassidy Dumbauld.182
            Further, Vince Haley, Taylor Swindle, and Ross Worthington are corporate officers
               of a company known as Pericles LLC.183 Haley is a former policy advisor to President Trump,184 Swindle is the Chief Financial Officer for Gingrich 360185, and Ross Worthington is the former White House speechwriter186 who wrote the speech President Trump delivered on the Ellipse on January 6th.187 Pericles LLC was registered on January 27, 2021,188 the day after Scavinos Hudson Digital LLC, and, since then, has received payments from Save America totaling
               at least $352,700.189 
            Another former speechwriter for President Trump, Robert Gabriel, Jr., has also been receiving payments from Save America. Gabriel was involved in
               writing the speech President Trump delivered on the White House Ellipse on January
               6th, and specifically told the speechwriters, including Worthington, to reinsert previously removed incendiary lines about Vice President Pence into the speech.190 This direction came after Vice President Pence told President Trump that he would
               not try to change the outcome of the election.191 In September 2021, Gabriel formed called Gabriel Strategies LLC,192 which began receiving payments from Save America the following month.193 Since October 2021, Save America has paid Gabriel Strategies LLC at least $167,674.00.194 For both Pericles and Gabriel Strategies, the description of the payments is always
               for consulting in political strategy or communications, and some payments are purported
               to include travel expenses. 
            Through October 2022, Save America has paid nearly $100,000 in strategy consulting
               payments to Herve Pierre Braillard,195 a fashion designer who has been dressing Melania Trump for years.196 
            From January 2021 to June 2022, Save America has also reported over $2.1 million in
               legal consulting. Many firms perform different kinds of practice, but more than
               67% of those funds went to law firms that are representing witnesses involved in the
               Select Committees investigation who were subpoenaed or invited to testify.
            Additionally, Save America has reported other expenditures, like:
            
               $1,000,000 donation to America First Policy Institute, home to several former Trump
                  officials and witnesses subpoenaed to testify before the Committee.197
               $1,000,000 donation to Conservative Partnership Institute, a conservative nonprofit
                  organization where Mark Meadows is a senior partner.198 
               More than $10.6 million to Event Strategies, Inc., the preferred staging company for
                  President Trump that staged the January 6th rally.199 
               More than $327,000 in payments to the Trump Hotel Collection and Mar-A-Lago Club since
                  the 2020 election.200
               An event sponsorship fee of $165,937.50 to American Conservative Union201, the Chairman of which is Matt Schlapp. Schlapp and his wife have offered to pay
                  the legal fees of witnesses called to testify before the January 6th Committee and
                  have extensive ties with former President Trump.
               A little over $140,000 to National Public Affairs, LLC202, a consulting company started by former Trump Campaign Manager Bill Stepien and Deputy
                  Campaign Manager Justin Clark.203 Stepien testified that he knew the claims of voter fraud were false, that he didnt
                  think what was happening was necessarily honest, and that he was stepping away from
                  the Trump Campaign.204 However, he continues to work and receive hundreds of thousands of dollars consulting
                  for President Trump and several other congressional candidates who continue to spread
                  false voter fraud claims related to the 2020 election.205
            
            C. Payments to 2M Management LLC 
            As described above, the Trump Campaign, after paying off its general election debt, raised millions of dollars that
                  flowed into a segregated recount account (Recount Account) by encouraging donors
                  to help pay for legal challenges to the election results. Pursuant to the FECA, the
                  Trump Campaign could only spend these funds on a few limited purposes (e.g., for actual recounts
                  and election-contest expenses or, in the case of surplus funds, donations to charitable organizations or transferring the funds to a national party committees separate, segregated account for election
                  recounts).206 
            Justin Clark told the Select Committee that he understood that, [a]fter election day, . . . you can raise money for a recount and to pay off debt,207 and that [t]he money going into the campaign, principal campaign committee, at that point, [after the election] was dead money. It couldnt be spent on things.208 Alex Cannon agreed.209 Thats why, after the election, the Trump Campaign set up the Recount Accounta segregated restricted account [held] by the
               campaign210and raised money for the Recount Account through TMAGAC.211
            In February 2021, the Trump Campaign was converted into MAGA PAC.212 In March 2021, MAGA PAC began disclosing on required FEC forms that it was paying
                  millions of dollars to an eDiscovery vendor called 2M Document Management &amp; Imaging
                  LLC (2M Management) for what MAGA PAC described as recount and Recount: Research
                  Consulting.213
            Although the MAGA PAC reported that 2M Management was being paid for recount-related
                  expenses, 2M Management was primarily processing and reviewing documents slated to
                  be produced by the National Archives and Records Administration in response to subpoenas
                  from (1) the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis (Covid Subcommittee) and (2) the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack.214 
            From just March 2021 to May 2021, MAGA PAC paid 2M Management almost $1 million from
                  the Recount Account to review documents related solely to the Covid Subcommittee.215 Alex Cannon confirmed that he understood these payments to 2M Management came from
                  the Recount Account.216 Federal campaign finance law requires committees to accurately report information
                  related to expenditures, including the purpose of payments. FEC regulations provide
                  that the purpose be described in relevant reports through a brief statement of why the disbursement was made and must be sufficiently specific to make the purpose
               of the disbursement clear.217 
            IMPACT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGNS FALSE CLAIMS 
            Between the election and January 6th, the Trump Campaign sent out hundreds of emails urging President Trumps supporters to fight the Liberal MOB and join the Trump army. Users on
               the same extreme social media platforms used to plan the attack on the Capitol, repeatedly
               shared the Official Election Defense Fund donation links in the week following election day.218 Links to donate were often accompanied by mentions of voter fraud and calls to save
               the country, mirroring the language of the fundraising emails and the countless discussions
               being held by the Presidents supporters of coming to Washington, DC, on January 6th to Stop the steal.219 
            On January 6th, while President Trump was speaking at the Ellipse rally and directing his supporters to march to the Capitol, his Campaign was also sending fundraising emails inflaming people to fight back. One
               email stated, 100 Members of Congress . . . Join them in the FIGHT to DEFEND the Election . . . This is our last line of defense.220 Another email stated, TODAY will be a historic day in our Nations history. Congress
               will either certify, or object to, the Election results. Every single Patriot from
               across the Country must step up RIGHT NOW if were going to successfully DEFEND the
               integrity of this Election.221 A third email stated, TODAY. This is our LAST CHANCE . . . The stakes have NEVER been higher. President Trump needs YOU to make a statement and
               publicly stand with him and FIGHT BACK.222 
            Thirty minutes after the last fundraising email was sent, the Capitol was breached.
               It was then and only then that TMAGAC fundraisers decided to stop sending emails containing
               baseless claims of election fraud.223 Boedigheimer explained, And at some point during that time, I dont know if it was
               right then, if it was a little after, maybe a little before, but either Gary or Kevin
               kind of directed us to stop sending fundraising messages out.224 Cannon stated, [O]n January 6th, Gary called me and said, []are you seeing whats happening? Im obviously turning everything off.[]225
            After raising $250 million dollars on false voter fraud claims, mostly from small-dollar
               donors, President Trump did not spend it on fighting an election he knew he lost.
               Instead, a significant portion of the money was deposited into the Save America account
               and not used for the purposes the Campaign claimed it would be. President Trump got
               a war chest with millions of dollars, and the American people were left with the U.S.
               Capitol under attack. 
            There is evidence suggesting that numerous defendants charged with violations related
               to the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol and others present on the Capitol grounds
               that day were motivated by false claims about the election.226 
            Further, J. Doe, the Salesforce employee interviewed by the Select Committee, provided insight
                  into the action that Salesforce took after the attack. Doe explained that after they
                  became aware of the ongoing attack, they (Doe) took unilateral action to block the
                  RNCs ability to send emails through Salesforces platform.227 Doe noted that the shutdown lasted until January 11, 2021, when senior Salesforce
                  leadership directed Doe to remove the block from RNCs Salesforce account.228 Doe stated that Salesforce leadership told Doe that Salesforce would now begin reviewing
                  RNCs email campaigns to make sure this doesnt happen again.229 
            Conclusion
            In the weeks after the 2020 election leading up to January 6, 2021, President Trumps
               Campaign and his allies sent his supporters a barrage of emails and text messages
               pushing lies about a stolen election and asking for contributions to challenge the
               outcome of the election. In reality, the funds raised went primarily towards paying
               down the Trump Campaigns outstanding 2020 debt, financing President Trumps newly
               created Save America PAC, and raising money for the RNC.
            Overall, only a small amount of the contributions ever went to President Trumps recount
               account or were otherwise obviously used in connection with post-election recounts
               or litigation. As President Trump used the Big Lie as a weapon to attack the legitimacy
               of the 2020 election, his Campaign used that same Big Lie to raise millions of dollars
               based on false claims and unkept promises. 
            Not only did President Trump lie to his supporters about the election, but he also
               ripped them off.
